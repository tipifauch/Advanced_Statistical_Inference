# Advanced_Statistical_Inference
 This course focuses on the principles of learning from data and quantification of uncertainty, by complementing and enriching the Introduction to Statistical Learning course. In particular, the course is divided into two main parts that correspond to the supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. The presentation of the material follows a common thread based on the probabilistic data modeling approach, so that many classical algorithms, such as least squares and k-means, can be seen as special cases of inference problems for more general probabilistic models. Taking a probabilistic view also allows the course to define and devise inference algorithms for a class of nonparametric models that have close connections with neural networks and support vector machines. Similarly to the Introduction to Statistical Learning course, the focus of the course is not on the algorithmic background of the methods, but rather on their mathematical and statistical foundations. This advanced course is complemented by several exercise sessions to guide students through the design and validation of the methods developed during the lectures. 

The expected learning outcomes for students following this course are :

    Learn the principles of prababilistic machine learning
    Acquire familiarity with mathematical and algebraic techniques needed to train probabilistic machine learning models
    Acquire familiarity with software packages to set up analyses of probabilistic machine learning algorithms
    Learn and apply techniques to design probabilistic supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms
    Apply machine learning algorithms in a variety of practical use cases, using real-life datasets 

Students will develop the following skill set :

    Conceive software systems and applications to analyze data using the language of probabilities
    Critical thinking and statistical validation of data analysis results
